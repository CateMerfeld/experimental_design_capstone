# Crime and Incarceration in the United States
---
## Background:
The United States has the highest incarcerated population in the world, with about 720 prisoners per 100,000 residents, according to the BBC. In 2018 the Department of Eduction found that the U.S. spends over $80 billion annually on corrections. They also found that, over the last 30 years, corrections spending has grown three times faster than education spending.

Crime reduction has long been a foundation of the U.S. corrections system, and a justification for its human and financial consequences. This analysis will address the question of whether or not incarceration leads to reduced crime.
