## Crime and Incarceration in the United States

### Background:
The United States has the highest incarcerated population in the world, with about 720 prisoners per 100,000 residents, according to the BBC. In 2018 the Department of Eduction found that the U.S. spends over $80 billion annually on corrections, a bill that is growing at three times the rate of education spending.

Support for our corrections system often comes from the idea that incarceration reduces crime. The research on this particular question is very limited, so policy makers and elected officials are often forced to make decisions without access to relevant data. The analysis from this project would be extremely helpful in that setting, and could serve as a jumping off point for more in depth regional analysis.

### The Data:

The data was obtained [here](https://github.com/CateMerfeld/experimental_design_capstone/commit/2e37ec02c8e3b49cf450f8d0a2185cec7feec6d7?branch=2e37ec02c8e3b49cf450f8d0a2185cec7feec6d7&diff=unified) 
It contains records for all 50 states, stretching from 2001 to 2016. Included are incarceration rates, crime rates by type, and state population. 

### Research Design:

My hypothesis was that there would be a difference in crime rate change between states with increased incarceration rates and decreased incarceration rates. I tested this by breaking the data into two groups based on states that had increased vs. decreased incarceration/capita over the 15 year period and then checking for statistically significant differences in crime rate change between the groups.  

### Results:
The results for violent vs property crime were different. I was not able to reject the null for property crime but violent crime did have a significant difference. States with increased incarceration rates had increases in violent crime as well. This is logical, as higher crime would typically lead to higher incarceration rates. It does not, however, support the theory that increasing incarceration decreases crime.
